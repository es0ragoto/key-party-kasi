There is no appetite in my radio
I want to smash you cause being bad

Love rocket
Love rocket

There is no appetite in my radio
I want to smash you cause being bad

Love rocket
Love rocket

Let it go, Smash you
Let it go, Smash you

"Kickin' my time
It's present from me
Kickin' my time
Just like this eternally"
