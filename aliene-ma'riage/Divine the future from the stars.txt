Divine the future from the stars
at church in a state of chaos
Our head crashed loudly
Bite my distorted mind

薔薇に手を差し伸べ　悪に憑かれた少女
イバラの棘纏い　踊り狂う

Divine the future from the stars
at church in a state of chaos
Swallow pill which you're proud
Disenchant your nightmare

夜の星を凝視め　悪を占う少女
イバラの棘纏い　踊り狂え

Divine　Divine
Divine the future from the stars
Divine　Divine
Divine the future from the stars

I'll be driven to despair　I'll be curse my fate
I'll be driven to despair　I'll be curse my fate

Divine　Divine
Divine the future from the stars
Divine　Divine
Divine the future from the stars

I'll be driven to despair　I'll be curse my fate
I'll be driven to despair　I'll be curse my fate

Divine　Divine
Divine the future from the stars
Divine　Divine
Divine the future from the stars
